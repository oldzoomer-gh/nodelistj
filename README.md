# NodelistJ

This is a Fidonet nodelist parser library for Java,
written mostly by me, but GigaCode (Sber's plugin for AI autocomplete,
Russian alternative of GitHub Copilot) also helped with some routine
moments (code documentation, writing some code of tests, basic code
review, etc).

GigaCode makes a big count of mistakes in code generation, that's why
mostly this library written by me, not by GigaCode. And I'm make library
with small footprint (except Lombok and jUnit5, nothing else libraries
is used).
